# ML_Basics_KAIST

This repository contains a beginner-level Machine Learning project using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates the **full ML workflow** on the Iris dataset.

## Project Overview

The project includes:
1. **Data Loading**: Iris dataset from Scikit-learn  
2. **Data Exploration**: Viewing features, target names, and sample rows  
3. **DataFrame Conversion**: Converting the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame for easy handling  
4. **Train/Test Split**: Splitting data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets  
5. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression model to predict flower types  
6. **Model Evaluation**: Checking accuracy on test data (achieved 100%)  
7. **Custom Predictions**: Predicting flower type for new input  
## Key Libraries Used
 **Pandas**: Data handling  
 **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning modeling and metrics
 **Matplotlib**: Data visualization  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. 2. Open ML Basic Day1and2 ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run each cell sequentially  
## Learning Outcome
- Understand basic ML workflow: data → train → test → predict  
- Train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model  
- Make custom predictions for new samples  
 This project demonstrates the ability to learn and implement Machine Learning basics in just 2 days, with hands-on practice, problem-solving, and readiness for more advanced AI projects.
